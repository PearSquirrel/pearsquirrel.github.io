title: New Website!

### The Reason
After using my old website for a while, I figured it needed a redesign.  The old website used wordpress, which is a great CMS for people who like the graphical front-end it provides.  As the person managing the website, though, I found it to be more of a nuisance than a time-saver.  The site was clunky and there was a lot of unused functionality that ended up making it a pain to backup or move around. Lastly, my old website was very slow.  Files were large and wordpress can't compare with the speed of loading static webpages.  I needed an easy way to put myself on the web without the actual implementation getting in my way.

### The Solution
That's where Jekyll comes in.  Jekyll is a simple, static, blog-aware framework that lets me put my content on the web without me having to worry about the details.  No more database management, no more updates to install, no security issues to worry about, and, one of the best things about it, no hosting fees!  This seems like it is too good to be true.  Luckily for me, it's not.  Using GitHub Pages, I can host static sites for free. Because Jekyll compiles my variable content into static pages, I can keep all the blog and templating functionality from wordpress while not having to maintain a database, AND GitHub will host it for me.  Jekyll is even fully integrated with GitHub so I don't have to worry about manually compiling the code down.  It just works.

### The Future
This is my first blog post.  Whenever I come up with something new and interesting, I'll be sure to share it here.  See you in the next one!
