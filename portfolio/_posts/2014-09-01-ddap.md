## About
The Darien Domestic Abuse Partnership is a non-profit organization in my hometown, Darien.  It holds the goal to provide the necessary support for those men and women suffering from abusive relationships in the home.  My job was to create a website for them that they can use and update by themselves.  Some of the features asked for included a news section they can use to spread information gathered in domestic abuse programs nationwide and a members-only section used as a resource for those involved with the organization.

## Features
* Custom content management system using WordPress developed for users 60+ years old
* Database-Driven Website installation
* Custom searchable and sortable news section
* Updatable News Ticker using custom fields
* Multiple page layouts
* Automatic main- and sub-menu navigation
* Members-only section for meeting notes
* Custom Event Calendar
* Option for Slideshow banners

## Process
This project was developed over a summer as an iterative process.  To understand what my clients wanted in their website, I held meetings with them, presenting different options until they were happy with my interpretation of their vision.
