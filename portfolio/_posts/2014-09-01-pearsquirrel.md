I make entertaining, educational videos for Minecraft players.  A typical video consists of me showing off an invention, explaining how it works, and showing my viewers how to build it.  On my channel I have minigames, automatic contraptions, resource-collection mechanisms, and transportation systems.

Minecraft is a great outlet for creativity as its logic-based circuitry system provides many different ways to accomplish the same goal; some solutions are quicker, some more efficient, and some more reliable.  By using this system, redstone, I can teach my viewers a little bit of logic and give them an idea of what goes on in my brain while I’m having fun.

Half of the video production process is recording the video. The other half is editing and marketing.  To develop my fanbase in a relatively short amount of time, I produced videos for topics I couldn’t find information about already or for areas that weren’t fully explored. I shared my findings with those who might be interested on a few forums and social media outlets.  Before I knew it, my channel was doubling in size every two months and soon enough I got to where I am now.
