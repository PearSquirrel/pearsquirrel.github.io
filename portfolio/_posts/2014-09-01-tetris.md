Tech-Specs: Java, Swing/AWT Framework, Graphics2D, Eclipse IDE

Project Overview
Using Java’s graphics libraries (Java2D, AWT, Swing), I recreated the popular game,Tetris. Additionally, I programmed an AI to maximize its worst-case performance through a genetic algorithm and a maxi-min algorithm.

Features

* Clockwise and Counter-Clockwise rotation
* Pause functionality
* Cleared Line Tally (Scoring System)
* Customizable board size
* All 7 tetrominos (Square, Line, T, L, Reversed L, S, and Z) with their own colors
* Custom graphics
* uses Java’s Timer class
* Genetic Algorithm
* AI to (hopefully) beat an adversary that picks the worst piece at any given turn
