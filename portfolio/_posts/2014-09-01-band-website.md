Project Overview
The band website had been dysfunctional and with a new band director came the need for change.  This new band website makes use of WordPress' CMS capabilities, allowing for easier management of posts, announcements, and audio recordings.  One of the requirements was for the website to operate without cutting into the bandâ€™s budget, a difficult challenge but one that could be overcome.

Features

* Audio recording section
* Simple content management system
* Able to be maintained by non-tech-savvy individuals
* regularly updated with announcements for the concert band, jazz band, and various small instrumental groups
